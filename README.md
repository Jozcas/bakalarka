# Bachelor thesis
## Mobile Application for Taking and Evaluating Photos During Sports Training
### Abstract - idea of application
The aim of this bachelor thesis is to design and create mobile application for sportsmen and trainners. Its essence is to take a photo of any exercise during training, the option to compare photos with referential photo of exercise and send it to the coach. Simultaneously, the application for the trainer allows the trainer to rate photo and send feedback to sportman. The application is implemented for Android using React Native and Firebase for storing data. The result is the application, which complements a number of existing mobile sports applications, using new functionality. The benefit of this work is its real use for acquiring
the habits of proper exercise technique in amateur athletes or more demanding exercises in advanced athletes.

### Camera screen
The camera screen is inspired by a mobile camera application but includes additional functionality necessary for taking photos during exercise. One such feature is the activation of a mat outline, which ensures that the sportman's mat is positioned within the outline displayed on the camera, helping to select the optimal location for the sportman in the photo.

### Setting screen
On the settings screen, the athlete can choose the method for taking a photo. He can select a timer, where he can set different timer durations and the number of photos to be taken, ensuring the best possible shot that captures the exercise position. The second option is voice control, where the photo is taken when a voice command is detected.
